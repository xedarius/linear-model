Linear model

Java implementation of a simple linear regression model that will learn two unknowns and attempt to fix these unknowns to a pre-generated dataset.

The function in question is the line equation (a * x + b or mx+c depending on where you were taught).

The code uses Stochastic Gradient descent to solve the problem.
